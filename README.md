# pg_tpch

Easy to use and reasonably fast TPCH support in Postgres in just Rust.

This project uses [tpchgen](https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen) and [pgrx](http://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx)
to allow you to seamless build TPCH datasets and run TPCH queries in Postgres.

This extension API was inspired by the ease of use of the DuckDB [TPCH extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/tpch.html)
